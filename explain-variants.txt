Can you explain why there are multiple sha ids for the same image? multiple examples can be seen in the report.json file

● Great observation! The multiple SHA IDs for what appears to be the "same image" is actually revealing important information about how RHOAI
  manages container images across different contexts. Let me explain what's happening:

  Why Multiple SHA256 Digests Appear

  1. Different Image Variants/Builds

  Even though they have the same base name (e.g., vllm), these are actually different builds of the same component:

  "quay.io/modh/vllm@sha256:3934334c8270789a08f0b40a7a54cc712864fff0838ac2990a3b5711e175eef5"
  "quay.io/modh/vllm@sha256:bf8437d698f91ce8127dd2ea43b2bd01091d567fc49cc9b99bd56bea27cfdc45"
  "quay.io/modh/vllm@sha256:db766445a1e3455e1bf7d16b008f8946fcbe9f277377af7abb81ae358805e7e2"

  Each SHA256 represents a unique image build with potentially different:
  - Python versions (3.11 vs 3.12)
  - Base OS versions (RHEL 8 vs RHEL 9)
  - CUDA/ROCm versions
  - Security patches applied at different times
  - Dependency versions

  2. Multi-Source Data Collection

  The reporter pulls from two different repositories:
  - OLM Catalogs (infrastructure context)
  - Disconnected Helper (air-gapped deployment context)

  The same logical component may appear in both sources but reference different specific builds suited for different deployment scenarios.

  3. Version Evolution Over Time

  RHOAI maintains multiple concurrent versions of components:
  - Current stable build
  - Previous stable build (for rollback)
  - Security-patched variants
  - Architecture-specific builds (x86_64, ARM64)
  
   4. Deployment Context Variations

  Looking at the CUDA Notebooks example:
  "quay.io/modh/cuda-notebooks@sha256:00c53599f..." // Build A
  "quay.io/modh/cuda-notebooks@sha256:0e57a0b7..."  // Build B  
  "quay.io/modh/cuda-notebooks@sha256:3da74d73..."  // Build C

  These likely represent:
  - Different CUDA versions (11.8, 12.0, 12.1)
  - Different Python versions (3.11, 3.12)
  - Different base image versions

  Real-World Example Analysis

  From your report.json, the vLLM component shows 6 images, but only 3 unique digests:
  - Each digest appears twice (once from OLM catalog, once from disconnected helper)
  - The 3 different digests likely represent different build variants

  Why This Matters for RHOAI Operations

  ✅ Deployment Flexibility

  - Production: Use most stable digest
  - Development: Use latest digest
  - Air-gapped: Use specific validated digests
 ✅ Security Management

  - Vulnerability tracking: Each digest has its own security profile
  - Patch management: Update specific digests without affecting others
  - Rollback capability: Previous digests remain available

  ✅ Compatibility Matrix

  - OpenShift 4.18: May use digest A
  - OpenShift 4.19: May use digest B
  - OpenShift 4.20: May use digest C

  Improving the Reporter

  We could enhance the analysis to show these relationships more clearly:

  # Show unique vs duplicate analysis
  ./rhoai_reporter.py --rhoai-version 2.23 --show-variants

  # Example enhanced output:
  # vLLM Component:
  #   - Base name: quay.io/modh/vllm
  #   - Unique builds: 3 
  #   - Total references: 6 (3 from OLM, 3 from disconnected helper)
  #   - Variants: CUDA 11.8, CUDA 12.0, CUDA 12.1

  This multi-digest approach is actually a feature, not a bug - it provides the granular control needed for enterprise AI/ML deployments where
  different environments may require different optimized builds of the same logical component.
